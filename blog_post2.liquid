     Prompt: Please write a short description of an astronaut encountering an intelligent dog wearing an astronaut suit far out in space. Write it in the first-person point of view as you are the astronaut finding the dog. (Slight modification to result to be able to include an apostrophe.)-->

{% blog_post '<img src="/images/space_dog.jpg" alt="A portrait of a dog wearing an astronaut suit among the cosmos" loading="lazy" />' 'I was conducting a routine spacewalk when I spotted something strange—at first, I thought it was a reflection off my visor, but no, there it was again, moving slowly toward me. A figure.<br>It looked like... a dog. But not just any dog. It was wearing a full astronaut suit, complete with a helmet. The canine&#39;s movements were deliberate, almost like it knew exactly what it was doing. I froze, my breath catching in my helmet. How in the world was a dog out here in space, and why was it wearing a suit like mine?<br>It stopped a few feet away from me, its tail wagging lazily in the zero gravity. The dog tilted its head, as if sizing me up, then gave a little bark—a sound so out of place, I had to double-check that I hadn’t somehow gone completely mad.<br>I wasn’t sure if I should be scared or amused, but somehow, I found myself smiling behind my visor. Space was vast and strange, and this moment felt like it belonged to a different kind of reality altogether. One where I, an astronaut, and a dog in an astronaut suit could meet—silently, floating together among the stars.' %}
