{% blog_post '<img src="/images/space_burger.png" alt="Astronaut encapsulated by floating burger in space" loading="lazy" />' 'I was floating out here in the silence of space, tethered to my ship, when I saw it. At first, I thought it was just some debris—an abandoned tool or a stray piece of equipment. But no, it was something... stranger. There, suspended in the vacuum, was a cheeseburger. A perfectly preserved cheeseburger. The bun gleamed under the distant light of the solar panels, the cheese still yellow and melted, the lettuce crisp as if it had just been assembled.<br>I blinked, trying to process what I was seeing. How? Why? Was this some weird experiment gone wrong? Or had the universe truly decided to mess with me?<br>With a shaky hand, I reached out, my glove brushing the sesame seeds on the top bun. It was real. It felt... oddly normal. I glanced back at the ship, but no answers were coming from that direction. Only the vast, silent void stretched out in every direction.<br>I couldn’t help but laugh—a little nervous, a little amazed. Here I was, light-years from Earth, and I had just found the universe’s most random, bizarre treasure: a floating cheeseburger.' %}
